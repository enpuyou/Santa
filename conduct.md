## Conduct

In this context, we define conduct as the way a team member behaves and the way
they act when carrying out their part of the project. First, everyone
is obligated to adhere to the nine categories in the Code of Conduct. They will be
our foundation throughout the semester when working together. Moving on, everyone
should respect one another; no one should be excluded based on their race or
gender. Team members should not shun the ideas of anyone, especially those who
may have not have had an equal amount of experience as others. Also, at the
beginning of each session, everyone should enter with positive attitudes, these
positive attitudes should stay consistent whether the project is working or
breaking.

* **Acceptable Conduct (C):**
  * *Members shall*
    * Respect all peers.
    * Allow all members to voice their opinion.
    * Show positive attitudes towards all aspects of the project.
* **Unacceptable Conduct (U):**
  * *Members shall not*
    * Exclude members of team based on their race or gender.
    * Refuse to follow the rest of the categories in the Code of Conduct.
    * Show a negative attitude towards group members or aspects of the project.

## Attendance

It is expected that you will attend all labs on time. If you and
your team deem it possible, team members may leave the lab, so long as they
are available via Slack for the allotted lab times. This would be considered
working remotely, and requires the consent of the other team members or
approval from the instructor. For further guidance on attendance in labs and
class please refer to the [course
website](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2019/), contact the
[instructor](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/contact/), or schedule an
[appointment](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/).

* **Acceptable Attendance (C):**
  * *Members shall*
    * Attend all lab sessions on time.
    * Miss sessions with consent of the course instructor.
    * Leave labs early with consent of all team members or the course instructor.
    * Be available on Slack during allotted lab times.
* **Unacceptable Attendance (U):**
  * *Members shall not*
    * Miss a lab session without consent of the course instructor.
    * Arrive more than 10 minutes late to a lab session.
    * Leave labs early while still needed by all team members.

## Deadlines

To determine appropriate policies for deadlines, it is first important to
break up deadlines into the different types of possible deadlines for the
course. The deadlines categories that are possible are those when working
directly with group members to finish work necessary to move onto other parts
of the lab, along with completing your assigned portion of the work by the due
date of the lab.

* **Acceptable Behavior (C):**
  * *Members shall*
    * Talk with team members and discuss work needed to be done.
    * Set up a reasonable time frame for when the work will be completed
  leaving time for the rest of the lab.
    * Take into consideration other people's schedules and activities as it may
    not align with yours.
    * If you can not come up with an agreed upon time frame, have a vote
    between all team members who are present to determine the time frame.
    * If problems still arise then seek out other team members.
    * Grade yourself based on the grading scale given to determine how well you
    followed the deadlines section.
    * All software project assignments completed have a specified due date,
    whereas the electronic copy must be uploaded to GitHub through the
    designated repository before the assigned deadline.
    * Software projects will be completed according to the deadline set by the
    students, and within the one week period before the next laboratory session
    begins.
* **Unacceptable Behavior (U):**
  * *Members shall not*
    * Fail to discuss issues with team members before due dates.
    * Fail to complete work on time.
    * Fail to participate in votes on materials without reason.
    * Fail to communicate reasons for work being late.
    * If work is submitted after the specified deadline, the assignment will not
    be accepted and no credit will be given (unless specified otherwise). All
    submitted software project assignments must contain high-quality, well
    documented code.

## Communication

Team members shall communicate fully, openly, and promptly regarding individual
comfort level and progress with an assigned task, as described below.

* Slack shall be the primary method of communication.
* **Acceptable Communication (C):**
  * *Members shall*
    * Communicate to others when they will be unable to attend any meeting.
    * Communicate about work in progress and personal time constraints.
    * Share any encountered problem immediately so the team can work toward a
    solution.
    * Critique the idea pitched, not the person pitching it.
  * *Team leads shall*
    * Give updates on all decision making to keep everyone involved.
    * Communicate deadlines and expectations to all team members.

    work.
    * Abuse leadership role to berate or act negatively towards any team members.

## Participation

Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work.
Participation gives room for exchange of ideas that people can work on and
implement as a group. In order to achieve the goals for the group, it is the
sole responsibility of every team member to be involved in the work going on.
The more we put into our efforts, the better will be the outcome. This can be
an amazing opportunity to bond well with the team members and bring positivity
that will bring long-term benefits for the team.

* **Acceptable Participation (C):**
  * *Members shall*
    * Participate in Slack discussions.
    * Be open to meeting outside of class time.
    * Ask questions when necessary.
    * Share one's views without dismissing others' views.
    * Enable discussions in a polite and pleasant form.
    * Disagree in a polite manner if required.
* **Unacceptable Participation (U):**
  * *Members shall not*
    * Fail to participate in Slack Polls.
    * Miss lab sections without consent of the course instructor.
    * Fail to ask questions or participating in discussions.
    * Fail to do their share of the labs.
    * Interrupt a team member with criticism without offering them the
    opportunity to share their views.
    * Make offensive comments during discussions.
    * Try to dominate a discussion.
    * Talk about topics entirely irrelevant to the discussions.

## Decisions

Decisions should be made in the environment where every team member's opinion
is considered important. They should be made collectively as a team or at
least 80% of the majority's consensus. All information needed to make a
decision should be clearly stated to every team member and all concerns should
be clearly expressed. We should use data, rational knowledge and specific
experience to make decisions instead of popular opinion. Team members should
objectively analyze the options for the best of the team. Trust and respect
the decisions made in order to move on the project.

* **Acceptable (A):**
  * *Members shall*
    * Consult technical leads, expertise, or instructor before a decision is
    made even if it is a popular opinion.
* **Unacceptable (U):**
  * *Members shall not*
    * Make decisions without notifying team members.
    * Complain about a decision after it has been
    agreed upon by the team(s) involved.
    * Take actions after the majority's agreement
    even if the decision is not officially made.

## Postmortems

Postmortems are an analysis and discussion soon after the launch of a software
project, in which we will discuss what was successful and what failed.
In the postmortems process of the project we will use proper communication and
teamwork in order to solve problems and issues. Going through postmortems will
help us to debug and ensure problems that arise get taken care of smoothly and
surely.

* **Acceptable Postmortems (C):**
  * *Members shall*
    * Talk in the first part of lab section to discuss where we are in the project.
    * Team leaders can lead through this discussion.
    * Teams will bring up problems and errors that occurred, or what worked well.
    * After finishing a project teams should be assigned to look after the program.
    * Work as a team to fix problems.
    * Use proper communication to talk to one another.
* **Unacceptable (U):**
  * *Members shall not*
    * Blame anyone for errors or problems.
    * Work alone, use your team members as a guide.
    * Attempt to change things without talking to others.

## Conflicts

When conflict arise within the working environment, we deal with conflicts in a
professional manner by communicating any type of issue/conflict with any of the
team leaders, technical leads, or the CEO directly.

* **Acceptable Behavior (C)**
  * *Members shall*
    * Report a conflict or potential conflict with either a team leader,
    technical lead or the CEO directly as soon as it arises or at the nearest
    availability.
  * *Team leads shall*
    * Be open and respect both sides looking for the most beneficial option
    towards the project.
    * Make decisions with the best interest of the team as a whole upon proper
    discussion.
* **Unacceptable Behavior (U)**
  * *Members shall not*
    * Unduly use their position/ influence in this project for personal
    benefit or to benefit relatives or close associates.
    * Bring about personal interests that will bring about conflicts with
    those of the team as a whole.
    * Disregard on a conflict that has not yet been discussed or resolved
    to prevent even further conflicts to arise.
  * *Team leads shall not*
    * Disregard any conflict that has been brought to their attention.
    * Use their position/ influence to make any type of decision that is not
    beneficial to the team as a whole.

## Infractions

An infraction shall hereby be defined as a penalty given as a result of a
violation of the above outlined Conduct Guide by any individual who has agreed
to adhere to the Conduct Guide via digital signature below. The infractions for
any individual shall be recorded and managed by the instructor.

A violation of the Conduct Guide can be defined as any behavior that is
considered Unacceptable (U) for any of the above outlined (sub)sections.

Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:

* **Level I**: A ***Level I infraction*** is defined as a formally documented
 violation of the above outlined Conduct Guide. A Level I infraction may be
 suggested to the instructor by a team or project leader for any given project.
 All Level I infractions will be reset weekly.
* **Level II**: A ***Level II infraction*** will be given to an individual who
 has accumulated three Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level II infraction,
 the individual will no longer be eligible to receive a check for the week. All
 Level II infractions will be reset weekly.
* **Level III**: A ***Level III infraction*** will be given to an individual who
 has accumulated five Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level III infraction,
 the individual will be docked 10% of their grade for the current project. All
 Level III infractions will be reset after the completion of the current project.

Level I infractions that count toward a Level II infraction also count toward a
Level III infraction. If an individual commits multiple violations of the
Conduct Guide, a team or project leader may suggest a proportional amount of
Level I infractions for the violations to the instructor, provided there is
proper citation to the Conduct Guide for the violations. While a team or project
leader may suggest any number of infractions, an individual *should* not incur
more than three infractions for a single instance of violations. The number
of Level I infractions imposed upon the individual shall ultimately be
determined by the instructor.

An individual who has received any number of infractions may appeal said
infraction(s) directly to the instructor of the course. Any decision received
from the instructor for being given the infraction(s) will be final.
